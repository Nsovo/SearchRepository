***Node-core streams for userland***

This package is a mirror of the Streams2 and Streams3 implementations in
Node-core.

If you want to guarantee a stable streams base, regardless of what version of
Node you, or the users of your libraries are using, use **readable-stream** *only* and avoid the *"stream"* module in Node-core.

As of version 2.0.0 **readable-stream** uses semantic versioning.
