  A JavaScript tokenizer / parser / beautifier / compressor.

  This version is suitable for Node.js.  With minimal changes (the
  exports stuff) it should work on any JS platform.

  This file contains the tokenizer/parser.  It is a port to JavaScript
  of parse-js [1], a JavaScript parser library written in Common Lisp
  by Marijn Haverbeke.  Thank you Marijn!

  Exported functions:

    - tokenizer(code) -- returns a function.  Call the returned
      function to fetch the next token.

    - parse(code) -- returns an AST of the given JavaScript code.
