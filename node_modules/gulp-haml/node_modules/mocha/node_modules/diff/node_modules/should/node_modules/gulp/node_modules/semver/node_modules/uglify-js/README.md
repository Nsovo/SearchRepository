UglifyJS 2
==========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mishoo/UglifyJS2.png)](https://travis-ci.org/mishoo/UglifyJS2)

UglifyJS is a JavaScript parser, minifier, compressor or beautifier toolkit.

This page documents the command line utility.  For
[API and internals documentation see my website](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/).
There's also an
[in-browser online demo](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/#demo) (for Firefox,
Chrome and probably Safari).

Install
-------

First make sure you have installed the latest version of [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
(You may need to restart your computer after this step).

From NPM for use as a command line app:

    npm install uglify-js -g

From NPM for programmatic use:

    npm install uglify-js

From Git:

    git clone git://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2.git
    cd UglifyJS2
    npm link .

Usage
-----

    uglifyjs [input files] [options]

UglifyJS2 can take multiple input files.  It's recommended that you pass the
input files first, then pass the options.  UglifyJS will parse input files
in sequence and apply any compression options.  The files are parsed in the
same global scope, that is, a reference from a file to some
variable/function declared in another file will be matched properly.

If you want to read from STDIN instead, pass a single dash instead of input
files.

The available options are:

    --source-map       Specify an output file where to generate source map.
                                                                          [string]
    --source-map-root  The path to the original source to be included in the
                       source map.                                        [string]
    --source-map-url   The path to the source map to be added in //@
                       sourceMappingURL.  Defaults to the value passed with
                       --source-map.                                      [string]
    --in-source-map    Input source map, useful if you're compressing JS that was
                       generated from some other original code.
    --screw-ie8        Pass this flag if you don't care about full compliance with
                       Internet Explorer 6-8 quirks (by default UglifyJS will try
                       to be IE-proof).
    -p, --prefix       Skip prefix for original filenames that appear in source
                       maps. For example -p 3 will drop 3 directories from file
                       names and ensure they are relative paths.
    -o, --output       Output file (default STDOUT).
    -b, --beautify     Beautify output/specify output options.            [string]
    -m, --mangle       Mangle names/pass mangler options.                 [string]
    -r, --reserved     Reserved names to exclude from mangling.
    -c, --compress     Enable compressor/pass compressor options. Pass options
                       like -c hoist_vars=false,if_return=false. Use -c with no
                       argument to use the default compression options.   [string]
    -d, --define       Global definitions
