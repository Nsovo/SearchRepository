Features
--------

* All-javascript instrumentation library that tracks **statement, branch,
and function coverage** and reverse-engineers **line coverage** with 100% fidelity.
* **Module loader hooks** to instrument code on the fly
* **Command line tools** to run node unit tests "with coverage turned on" and no cooperation
whatsoever from the test runner
* **HTML**, **LCOV**, **Cobertura**, **TeamCity**, and **Clover** reporting.
* Ability to use as **middleware** when serving JS files that need to be tested on the browser.
* Can be used on the **command line** as well as a **library**
* Based on the awesome `esprima` parser and the equally awesome `escodegen` code generator
* Well-tested on node 0.4.x, 0.6.x, 0.8.x and the browser (instrumentation library only)

Installing
----------

    $ npm install -g istanbul

Getting started
---------------

The best way to see it in action is to run node unit tests. Say you have a test
script `test.js` that runs all tests for your node project without coverage.

Simply:

    $ cd /path/to/your/source/root
    $ istanbul cover test.js

and this should produce a `coverage.json`, `lcov.info` and `lcov-report/*html` under `./coverage`

Sample of code coverage reports produced by this tool (for this tool!):

* [HTML reports](http://gotwarlost.github.com/istanbul/public/coverage/lcov-report/index.html)
* [Standard LCOV reports](http://gotwarlost.github.com/istanbul/public/coverage/std-lcov/index.html) (using `genhtml` on the lcov trace file)

Use cases
---------

Supports the following use cases and more

* transparent coverage of nodejs unit tests
* ability to use in an <code>npm test</code> script for conditional coverage
* instrumentation of files in batch mode for browser tests (using yeti for example)
* Server side code coverage for nodejs by embedding it as custom middleware


Ignoring code for coverage
--------------------------

* Skip an `if` or `else` path with `/* istanbul ignore if */` or `/* istanbul ignore else */` respectively.
* For all other cases, skip the next 'thing' in the source with: `/* istanbul ignore next */`

See [ignoring-code-for-coverage.md](ignoring-code-for-coverage.md) for the spec.

The command line
----------------

    $ istanbul help

gives you detailed help on all commands.

Usage: istanbul help <command>

Available commands are:

      check-coverage
              checks overall coverage against thresholds from coverage JSON
              files. Exits 1 if thresholds are not met, 0 otherwise


      cover   transparently adds coverage information to a node command. Saves
              coverage.json and reports at the end of execution


      help    shows help


      instrument
              instruments a file or a directory tree and writes the
              instrumented code to the desired output location


      report  writes reports for coverage JSON objects produced in a previous
              run


      test    cover a node command only when npm_config_coverage is set. Use in
              a
