[Coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io/) support for node.js.  Get the great coverage reporting of coveralls.io and add a cool coverage button ( like the one above ) to your README.

Supported CI services:  [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/), [codeship](https://www.codeship.io/), [circleci](https://circleci.com/), [jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/)

##Installation:
Add the latest version of `coveralls` to your package.json:
```
npm install coveralls --save-dev
```

If you're using mocha, add `mocha-lcov-reporter` to your package.json:
```
npm install mocha-lcov-reporter --save-dev
```

##Usage:

This script ( `bin/coveralls.js` ) can take standard input from any tool that emits the lcov data format (including [mocha](http://mochajs.org/)'s [LCov reporter](https://npmjs.org/package/mocha-lcov-reporter)) and send it to coveralls.io to report your code coverage there.

Once your app is instrumented for coverage, and building, you need to pipe the lcov output to `./node_modules/coveralls/bin/coveralls.js`.

This library currently supports [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/) with no extra effort beyond piping the lcov output to coveralls. However, if you're using a different build system, there are a few environment variables that are necessary:
* COVERALLS_SERVICE_NAME  (the name of your build system)
* COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN (the secret repo token from coveralls.io)

There are optional environment variables for other build systems as well:
* COVERALLS_SERVICE_JOB_ID  (an id that uniquely identifies the build job)
* COVERALLS_RUN_AT  (a date string for the time that the job ran.  RFC 3339 dates work.  This defaults to your
build system's date/time if you don't set it.)
