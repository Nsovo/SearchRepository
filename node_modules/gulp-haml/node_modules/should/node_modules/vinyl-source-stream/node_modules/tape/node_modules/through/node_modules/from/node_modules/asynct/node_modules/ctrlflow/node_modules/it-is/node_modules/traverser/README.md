#Traverser#

search through a complex object (nearly) as easily as forEach

all the nitty-gritty stuff is taken care of.

including:
  # checking for repeats.
  # checking for cycles.
  # getting the path the the current object. etc!

#simple example#
collect all branches in a tree.

    var traverser = require('traverser')
      , branches = []

    function branch(props){
      if(!props.reference) //since we check for references with will work in cyclic graphs, without stackoverflows.
        branches.push(props.value)

      props.each()//continue working through the children of this object.
    }

    traverser([1,2,{},3,["x"]],{branch: branch})
    
    console.log(branches)

#simple example2#
collect all leaves in a tree. (only functions and primitives)

    var traverser = require('traverser')

    exports.leaves = leaves

    function leaves (obj){
        var leaves = []

        function leaf(props){
          leaves.push(props.value)
        }

        traverser(obj,{leaf: leaf})
        return l
