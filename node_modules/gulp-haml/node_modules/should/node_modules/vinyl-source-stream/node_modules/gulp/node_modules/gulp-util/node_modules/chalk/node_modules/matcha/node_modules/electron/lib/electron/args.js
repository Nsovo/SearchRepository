/**
 * ## Argument Parsing Utility
 *
 * The electron argument parser takes the node.js standard
 * `process.argv` array and constructs an object with helpers
 * that can easily be queried. This helper is publicly exposed
 * so it can be used independant of the cli framework.
 *
 *     var electron = require('electron')
 *       , argv = electron.argv(process.argv);
 *
 * When constructed, the electron argv parser recognizes three
 * types command line arguments: _commands_, _modes_, and _parameters_.
 *
 * Each of these types also has a helper that will provide quick access
 * to whether a _command_ or _mode_ is present, or the value of a _parameter_.
 *
 * ##### Commands
 *
 * Commands are the simplest of arguments. They are any arguments
 * that are listed to that do not start with the `-` or `--` prefix.
 * Essentially, they are a list of keys.
 *
 *     // $ node cli.js hello universe
 *     argv.commands === [ 'hello', 'universe' ];
 *
 * ##### Modes
 *
 * Modes are also a non-value list of keys, but they can be expressed
 * differently by using the `-` or `--` prefix. When using modes, if
 * it begins with a single `-`, each letter will be parsed as its own mode.
 *
 *     // $ node cli.js --universe -abc
 *     argv.modes === [ 'universe', 'a', 'b', 'c' ];
 *
 * ##### Parameters
 *
 * Paremeters are key:value pairs that are declared in a
