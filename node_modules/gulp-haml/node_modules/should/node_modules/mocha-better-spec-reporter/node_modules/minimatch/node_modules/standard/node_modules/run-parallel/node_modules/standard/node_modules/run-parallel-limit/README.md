### install

```
npm install run-parallel-limit
```

### usage

#### parallelLimit(tasks, limit, [callback])

Run the `tasks` array of functions in parallel, with a maximum of `limit` tasks executing
at the same time. If any of the functions pass an error to its callback, the main
`callback` is immediately called with the value of the error. Once the `tasks` have
completed, the results are passed to the final `callback` as an array.

Note that the `tasks` are not executed in batches, so there is no guarantee that the first
`limit` tasks will complete before any others are started.

It is also possible to use an object instead of an array. Ea
